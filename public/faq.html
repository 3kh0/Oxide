  <h1>FAQ and stuff</h1>
  <p>Because some people have questions</p>
  <p><a href="/">Homepage</a></p>

  <h2>Why so ugly?</h2>
  <p>Because it doesn't need to be fancy.</p>
  <p>The web has become clogged with needless crap because it makes you feel suave that your looking at something cool and wow isn't this neat oh cool its so smooth</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, it takes an extra 3 seconds to load crap because your browsers gotta do some processing to put some goddamned text on your screen.</p>
  <p><b>NO. NO NO NO NO.</b></p>

  <h2>Where is panic key thing?</h2>
  <p>Me when ctrl+tab:</p>
  <p>Just press it faster anyway, and plus have good awareness of your surroundings I guess</p>

  <h2>Are you going to add themes</h2>
  <p>No, dark mode and light mode is just fine</p>

  <h2>Why would you make such a thing?</h2>
  <p>I was traveling at the time, and did not have alot of time, plus the theme for the TitaniumNetwork Proxathon 2024 was minimalism, so I did just that</p>
  <p>and also because I can</p>

  <h2>What is running behind this?</h2>
  <p>This uses the normal Ultraviolet app with a custom front end. Backend is still pretty much the same except for some minor changes here and there</p>

  <h2>It does not work</h2>
  <p>ok</p>

  <h2>Is the code public?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/3kh0/Oxide">github.com/3kh0/Oxide</a></p>
  <p><s>Why would you want to look at something so awful</s></p>

  <h2>But it has css!!</h2>
  <p>CSS is very minimal, if you want to, you can disable it and all features will still work</p>
  <p>The only purpose of the css is to make it somewhat organized</p>

  <h2>But it has javascript!!</h2>
  <p>Yes, because otherwise the proxy would not work, cry about it</p>
  <p>If you want just edit the code yourself to remove stuff you hate and self host</p>

  <h2>How long did it take you to make this?</h2>
  <p>2 hours, 12 minutes, and 34 seconds</p>

  <h2>Never code again</h2>
  <p>:(</p>
