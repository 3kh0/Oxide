  <h1 style="margin: 0;">404 Error</h1>
  <p style="margin: 0;">That didn't work out. Most likely it was a issue with the service worker.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0;">Go back to the homepage and the issue should sort itself out.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0;">If this keeps on happening, open a issue on the github (link on homepage) and I will try to fix it.</p>
